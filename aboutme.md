### Right now

I'm a robotics researcher at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)
in Pasadena, CA, currently working on machine vision for robot localization and grasping in the context of the [Mars Sample Return](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-sample-return-msr) mission.
Prior to joining JPL in 2018, I spent two years as a research scientist at [IBM Research AI](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/tokyo/),
Tokyo, where I worked on deep reinforcement learning for robot vision and manipulation.

### Background

Before joining IBM, I did my Ph.D. between the
[University of Montpellier](http://www.umontpellier.fr/), France,
and the [CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory](https://unit.aist.go.jp/is/jrl/ci/), Japan.
My thesis was on contact force sensing from motion tracking,
using various techniques from computer vision, machine learning and robotics.
Before that, I received a Master's in applied mathematics from [Université Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/),
a [Diplôme d'Ingénieur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me_d%27Ing%C3%A9nieur) in aerospace engineering from [SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en),
and had the opportunity to intern in satellite control at
[Airbus Defence and Space](http://company.airbus.com/careers/Our-locations/Friedrichshafen.html)
and computer vision at the [FORTH Institute of Computer Science](http://users.ics.forth.gr/~argyros).
